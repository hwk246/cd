<h2>implementing yml file</h2>
<p>
  First test of the yml file was not a succes I accidentally made a
  requirement.txt from the global dependancies. This is not required. It also
  included wincpy wich could not be installed. After deleting wincpy from the
  requirements the test passed. Including the added greenlight.py and
  test_greenlight.py.
