<h2>implementing yml file</h2>
<p>
  First test of the yml file was not a succes I accidentally made a
  requirement.txt from the global dependancies. This is not required. It also
  included wincpy wich could not be installed. After deleting wincpy from the
  requirements the test passed. Including the added greenlight.py and
  test_greenlight.py.
</p>
<p>
  This python test file was presented as an example by Github it includes a lint
  test wich check the code syntax on code-line-length and blank lines. It also
  does a pytest. In this case on a simple python add function written in
  greenlight.py
